<h1 class="h1 mb-0 text-gray-800">Control</h1>
<p>
    The main function of a greenhouse is to provide a controlled environment for plants.
</p>

<p>
    To do this, the <b>temperature</b> and <b>humidity</b> need to be controlled. 
Control of <b>light</b> and <b>irrigation</b> in greenhouse is also important for maintaining the health of plants. 
Also  greenhouse <b>ventilation</b> is an important component of greenhouse design.
</p>

<h5><b>Temperature and humidity</b></h5>
<p>
    The temperature and humidity are controlled by a series of <i>fans and vents</i> that can be opened or closed.  
    The temperature is also monitored with sensors placed throughout the greenhouse to ensure that it stays within a certain range.
    The humidity is controlled by a vent that releases water vapor over the plants. 
    This ensures that there is just enough moisture in the air to keep plants healthy but not so much that it becomes too damp and causes mold to grow on leaves.
</p>

<h5><b>Light</b></h5>
<p>
    Most plants need at least 10 hours of light every day in order to grow properly. 
    In a greenhouse, you can use artificial lights to provide this light and keep the plants growing year-round. 
    There are two types of greenhouse lights: high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, which produce orange light that’s best for growing vegetables and metal halide (MH) lamps, which produce white light that’s best for growing flowers. 
    The amount of light required will depend on the type of plants you’re growing and where they are in their life cycle. <br/>
    The use of LED lighting in greenhouse can help reduce energy costs. 
    <i>Grow LED strips</i> are designed to provide supplemental light to plants in a controlled environment, which can help them grow faster and healthier than those that don’t receive supplemental lighting. 
    These lights also emit little heat, so they won’t affect the temperature inside the greenhouse.
</p>

<h5><b>Ventilation</b></h5>
<p>
    A well-designed and properly installed ventilation system allows for the control of temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels. 
    This can be accomplished through either natural or mechanical ventilation. 
    Natural ventilation relies on air movement through the use of vents at the top of the structure that allow hot air to escape while cooler air enters from below.
    The use of mechanical ventilation is often preferred because it can be more effective in controlling air movement. 
    This method uses an exhaust fan and a <i>fresh air intake vent</i> to provide the proper amount of ventilation for your greenhouse.
</p>

<h5><b>Irrigation</b></h5>
<p>
    Greenhouse irrigation systems are designed to provide a constant water supply to plants, which can help prevent moisture stress.
    Moisture stress is one of the most common reasons why plants die in greenhouses during the winter months. 
    The lack of light and warm temperatures inside a greenhouse also contribute to this problem.
    The most common method of greenhouse irrigation is to use a drip irrigation system. 
    Drip lines are installed under the soil, directly at the base of each plant. 
    The drip line is connected to a water supply and an automatic timer that drips water into the soil as needed.
